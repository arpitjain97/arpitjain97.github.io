                        <h2><span>&raquo;About</span></h2>
                        <p>I'm <strong> Arpit Jain</strong>, and I love technologies. 
                            Always find a way to learn new things and try to make something out of it,
                             which can make an impact. I try the BFS approach in real life rather than DFS.
                              I believe that learning is the key to success that's why I don't feel like  I'm a Web Developer or a Python developer or a Java Developer, rather I say I'm a developer. I'm quite flexible to work in different environments. Having a tendency to explore the Black Box functionality behind everything is what makes me curious about knowing the nitty-gritty of everything.
                               I'm a fresher with a part-time work experience in an organization. </p>

                                <p>I'm <strong> Arpit Jain</strong>, and I love technologies. 
                                    Always find a way to learn new things and try to make something out of it,
                                     which can make an impact. I try the BFS approach in real life rather than DFS.
                                      I believe that learning is the key to success that's why I don't feel like  I'm a Web Developer or a Python developer or a Java Developer, rather I say I'm a developer. I'm quite flexible to work in different environments. Having a tendency to explore the Black Box functionality behind everything is what makes me curious about knowing the nitty-gritty of everything.
                                       I'm a fresher with a part-time work experience in an organization. </p>
